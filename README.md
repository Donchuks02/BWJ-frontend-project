### What I learned

I learned how to use the "details" and "summary" HTML tags.
i was awed by thier behaviour.

 see code snippets, see below:

```html
 <details open>
        <summary>Show more</summary>
  </details>```

also in javascript this code grabs an element in the current page and displays it on the next page,

```js
 window.open('paymentPage.html?imageSrc=' + encodeURIComponent(currentImgSrc) + '&text=' + encodeURIComponent(currentText) + '&additionalText=' + encodeURIComponent(currentAdditionalText) + '&additionalPrice=' + encodeURIComponent(currentPrice), '_blank');
```
